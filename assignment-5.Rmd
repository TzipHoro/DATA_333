## What was the relationship between population size and the number of gun murders in 2010?

```{r echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("dslabs")
library(dslabs)
library(ggplot2)
```




```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
ggplot(murders, aes(x = population, y = total)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + 
  ggtitle("Number of Gun Murders by Population") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = 'black')

```



The plot shows that the number of gun murders per state in 2010 increases as population increases, independent of which region the state is in.
